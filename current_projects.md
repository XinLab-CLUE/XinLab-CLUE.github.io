## Bilingualism/Multilingualism
### Beyond Segments: (Xin Wang, Bob McMurray, Funding: ARC DP)
This project aims to understand how healthy adult bilinguals resolve competition from their unintended language to communicate successfully in the intended language, using eye-tracking techniques. In both bilingual language comprehension and production, the project will characterise the role of an under-explored linguistic dimension, lexical tone, in cross-language processing.
