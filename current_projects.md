## Bilingualism/Multilingualism
### Beyond Segments: towards a lexical model for tonal bilinguals (Xin Wang, Bob McMurray, Funding: ARC DP)
This project aims to understand how healthy adult bilinguals resolve competition from their unintended language to communicate successfully in the intended language, using eye-tracking techniques. In both bilingual language comprehension and production, the project will characterise the role of an under-explored linguistic dimension, lexical tone, in cross-language processing. 

### Neural mechanisms of cross-langauge tone processing: evidence from MEG studies (Xindong Zhang, Xin Wang, Judy. Du. Zhu, Junjie Wu, Paul. F. Sowman, Funding; CSC-MQ scholarship)
Pitch variation in tonal languages (i.e., lexical tone) like Mandarin Chinese play a crucial role in constraining spoken word recognition. In contrast, pitch variation in non-tonal languages like English typically serve prosodic rather than lexical functions, signaling aspects such as speaker emotion or sentence modality (e.g., declarative vs. interrogative), without changing the meaning of individual words. Building on this cross-linguistic distinction, the present thesis investigates how pitch variations are processed across tonal and non-tonal language systems at the neural level, using magnetoencephalography (MEG).
