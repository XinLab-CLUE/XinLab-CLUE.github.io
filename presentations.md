### Upcoming lab meetings

Every two weeks on Mondays at 11:00 AEST, we get together (in person) for lab presentations (with food! sometimes).
On a rotating basis, each member of the lab speaks and teaches about something they know or shares their work. 
Anything, really. Relevant and interesting topics, good statistic skills to know, new findings and literature reviews... anything!
