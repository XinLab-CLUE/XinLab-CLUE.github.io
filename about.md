### About us
We are a group of language researchers interested in testing hypotheses empirically to understand language processing and representations. Our research in psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, bilingualism/multilingualism, and second language acquisition supports healthy and thriving communities by advancing understanding of how people process, learn and maintain multiple languages, enabling more inclusive education, healthcare, and public communication for Australia’s linguistically diverse population.

### Research
Our work has a strong interdisciplinary nature and thus utilizes various experimental methods and techniques. At the conceptual level, our work addresses questions of how linguistic information and structures are processed and represented in the bilingual/multilingual mind and brain. We study how linguistic information from one language influences the other with both behavioural and neural measures, and how we can use cross-language processing mechanisms to develop useful language assessment tools and teaching practice in multilingual contexts, including second language learners, heritage language speakers, and speech/language therapists for multilingual patients.

We heavily invest in training students to develop experimental skills. For example, we primarily use Masked Priming and Eye-Tracker techniques (e.g., Visual World Paradigm) to understand language processing. We’ve also collaborated with people with neural techniques (EEG/MEG) to train students to use these tools to understand language processing.

We’ve pursued projects that involve using masked priming data to build bilingual and trilingual lexical models, morphology in bilingualism, the orthographic depth hypothesis in bilingualism, language switching and code-switching in comprehension, language control in bilingual language production, the interface between lexical tone and bilingualism (e.g., modelling tonal bilingualism), lexical tone in cross-modal perceptual learning, tone timing, input processing in second language learning and processing, etc.

### Lab Culture

As a group, we value **respect, hard work, scientific curiosity, and innovation**. Our lab is a wonderful place for anyone who is super-driven and likes to learn ideas/skills quickly. HDR students are generally the chief of their own projects, but they also have the opportunity to work with others or senior people under close supervision.

**Being open and transparent** is the key to success in our lab. Any lab member is encouraged to discuss any issues with the lab director and other members. Currently, we host lab meetings every fortnight, as well as individual project meetings scheduled per student’s needs.

We also invite outside speakers to visit the lab and provide specific training to students. From time to time, we organize lab socials. Any good ideas to promote lab life, please email or talk to us.

We also heavily invest in PACE, Research Rotation students, and Interns at the undergraduate level. We believe they are an integral part of our lab membership and contribute their share of interesting thoughts and work.
